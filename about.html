    My name is <b>Laurent Stacul</b>. I was born in 1981 in south west of
    France and, for the time being, I am living in the French Riviera area.
    When my parents bought an <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST">Atari 520 STE</a>, I dived
    into the magic world of computers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I worked several years for <a href="http://www.amadeus.com">Amadeus SAS</a>
    as C++ middleware engineer. I am currenctly working as Backend Engineer at
    <a href="https://www.onfido.com">Onfido</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am always curious of new languages/tools/frameworks which make the job of
    developer so interesting.

    My wife is a <a href="http://www.prettypix.fr">fantastic web designer and a great artist </a>.
    We are both fond of cyclism and long bike trips.
