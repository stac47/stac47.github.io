This post evolves each time I discover an exciting feature of Vim.

## Pasting The Output of a Shell Command

Recently, I wondered if it was possible to display in a buffer a specific
revision of a file taken from the Git repository of my project without leaving
Vim. In my case, the file was removed in the latest branches on the project and
I had to backport some logic that was in the original file.

I ended up on the __read__ command and more precisely to the following form
which is documented at `:h read!`:

> :[range]r[ead] [++opt] !{cmd}

So if I want to fill an empty buffer with the file of a specified
commit/branch:

```
:r !git show old_branch:src/build.sh
```
