This post evolves each time I discover an exciting feature of Vim.

## Pasting The Output of a Shell Command

Recently, I wondered if it was possible to display in a buffer a specific
revision of a file taken from the Git repository of my project without leaving
Vim. In my case, the file was removed in the latest branches on the project and
I had to backport some logic that was in the original file.

I ended up on the __read__ command and more precisely to the following form
which is documented at `:h read!`:

> :[range]r[ead] [++opt] !{cmd}

So if I want to fill an empty buffer with the file of a specified
commit/branch:

```
:r !git show old_branch:src/build.sh
```

## Insert The Current Date/Time

We can use the Vim internal `strftime()` function with the `put` command (see
`:h strftime()` and `:h put`). Be careful, your system needs to have this
function available.

So to insert the current date in the default format:
```
:pu=strftime('%c')
```
## Update Plugin Help Tags

Sometimes it can occur that some plugin's help is not available. If the plugins
you use are installed via the Vim 8's plugins manager, you can simply use the
following command to regenerate all the help tags of all the installed plugins
```
:helptags ALL
```

More info there: `:h helptags`
